From ride pricing to distances traversed and everything in between, how does weather effect ridesharing.\n","\n","Both authors of this report are midwesterners, familiar with commuting through all different weather conditions. From hot summer months to bitter cold winter months transportation choices evolve.\n","\n","Previous studies have attempted to address this question, and certainly helped to shape the type of questions that we proposed for our analysis. In the study \"An empirical analysis of taxi, Lyft and Uber rides: Evidence from weather shocks in NYC\" author Abel Brodeur writes \"Using all taxi, Lyft and Uber rides in New York City, we show that the number of Uber and Lyft rides is significantly correlated with whether it rained. The number of Uber (Lyft) rides per hour is about 22 (19)% higher when it is raining, while the number of taxi rides per hour increases by only 5% in rainy hours-suggesting that surge pricing (prime time) encourages an increase in supply.\" [1] This study focuses primarily on rain and its effect on ride frequency. We decided that looking more broadly at temperature (and other weather related attributes) and its effect on rideshare pricing would be an interesting next step for this analysis.\n","\n","That is where the authors of this project wanted to ask some interesting questions to see if different rideshare metrics correlated with weather data. We narrowed our scope to one major city, Chicago Illinois. Utilizing rideshare data provided by the Chicago Data Portal (CDA) and weather data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmosphereic Administration (NOAA) we attempted to answer some questions:\n","\n","1. Do changes in weather affect ride fare?\n","    - We have both observed that on colder days, it seems like the cost of various rideshare services increases.\n","2. Do changes in weather affect average rideshare distance travelled?\n","    - Are people less willing to walk short distances when the weather is treacherous?\n","3. Do changes in weather affect ride frequency?\n","    - During inclement weather, are more people using rideshare services?\n","\n","These questions provided a starting point for us to deliver an analysis."],"metadata":{"id":"eeXAwN5yLj3l"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data Sources"],"metadata":{"id":"cX5Tx5SKLqLh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### NOAA Dataset\n","\n","The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) dataset was captured by downloading it from their website: \n","https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/locations/CITY:US170006/detail No API was needed and the data was very easy to download using the NOAA's \"shopping cart\" method.\n","\n","The data is returned in a *.csv format and was able to be saved in a convenient filepath to be used for this project.
